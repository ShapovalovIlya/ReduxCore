    /// An asynchronous sequence that combines each element from an upstream async sequence with a weakly retained object.
    ///
    /// `WithUnretained` wraps a base `AsyncSequence` and yields a tuple containing a weakly retained object and each element from the base sequence.
    /// The sequence automatically terminates if the upstream sequence finishes, the parent task is cancelled, or the object is released (deallocated).
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///    - Base: The type of the underlying async sequence.
    ///    - Object: The type of the object to be weakly retained. Must be a class type (`AnyObject`).
    ///
    /// ### Example
    /// ```swift
    /// class MyClass {}
    /// let object = MyClass()
    /// let numbers = [1, 2, 3].async
    /// for await (obj, number) in numbers.withUnretained(object) {
    ///     print(obj, number)
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Note: If `object` is deallocated, the sequence ends.
