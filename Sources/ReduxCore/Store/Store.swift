/// A thread-safe, observable state container for managing application state and dispatching actions.
///
/// The `Store` class is a generic, thread-safe container that serves as the central point for state management in your application.
/// Inspired by architectures like Redux and The Composable Architecture, `Store` enables predictable, unidirectional data flow through a combination of state, actions, and reducers.
///
/// ## Core Features
/// - **Thread Safety:** All state mutations and actions are processed synchronously on a dedicated dispatch queue, ensuring safe access and mutation from any thread.
/// - **Observability:** State is published via `@Published`, making it easy to observe from SwiftUI views or Combine pipelines.
/// - **Flexible Subscriptions:** Supports both strong (drivers) and weak (streamers) subscription models for state observation.
/// - **Action Dispatching:** Actions are dispatched to the store and applied to the current state using a reducer function.
/// - **Encapsulation:** The `StoreGraph` abstraction allows you to expose only state and dispatch capability to child components, without leaking the full store.
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// // Creating a Store
///
/// enum CounterAction { case increment, decrement }
///
/// struct CounterState {
///     var count: Int = 0
/// }
///
/// let reducer: Store<CounterState, CounterAction>.Reducer = { state, action in
///     switch action {
///     case .increment:
///         state.count += 1
///     case .decrement:
///         state.count -= 1
///     }
/// }
///
/// let store = Store<CounterState, CounterAction>(initial: CounterState(), reducer: reducer)
///
/// // Dispatching single Action
/// store.dispatch(.increment)
/// store.dispatch(.decrement)
///
///  // Dispatching sequence of Actions
/// store.dispatch(contentsOf: [.increment, .increment, .decrement]) // as array or set
/// store.dispatch(.increment, .increment, .decrement) // as variadic parameter
///
/// // Subscribing with a Streamer (Weak Subscription)
/// let streamer = StateStreamer<Store.StoreGraph>()
/// Task {
///     for await graph in streamer {
///         print("Streamer received count:", graph.count)
///     }
/// }
/// store.subscribe(streamer)
/// // As long as `streamer` is retained, it will receive state updates.
///
/// store.unsubscribe(streamer)
/// // or you manualy unsubscribe streamer
///
/// // Installing a Driver (Strong Subscription)
/// let driver = Store<CounterState, CounterAction>.GraphStreamer()
/// Task {
///     for await graph in driver.state {
///         print("Driver received count:", graph.count)
///     }
/// }
/// store.install(driver)
/// // The store retains `driver` until you explicitly uninstall it.
///
/// store.uninstall(driver)
///
/// ```
///
/// ## Subscription Models
/// - **Drivers (`GraphStreamer`):** Strongly-held subscribers that receive state updates until explicitly uninstalled.
/// - **Streamers (`ObjectStreamer`):** Weakly-held subscribers that receive state updates as long as they are referenced elsewhere.
///
/// ## Design Notes
/// - Reducers should be pure functions that mutate only the provided state and avoid side effects.
/// - The `graph` property provides a safe, weakly-referenced abstraction for passing state and dispatching to child components or views.
/// - Deprecated observer APIs are retained for backward compatibility but will be removed in future versions; use `StateStreamer` or `ObjectStreamer` for new code.
///
/// ## Type Parameters
/// - `State`: The type representing the state managed by the store.
/// - `Action`: The type representing actions that can be dispatched to the store.
///
/// ## Best Practices
/// - Use the store’s public API for all interactions to maintain thread safety and data integrity.
/// - Prefer drivers for long-lived, strongly-held subscriptions.
/// - Use streamers for ephemeral or weakly-held observers.
///
/// The `Store` class provides a robust foundation for scalable, predictable state management in any Swift application.

    //MARK: - Aliases
    
    /// A type alias representing the graph abstraction of the store's current state and dispatcher.
    ///
    /// `StoreGraph` is a convenience alias for `Graph<State, Action>`, encapsulating both the current state
    /// and a dispatcher for sending actions. This abstraction allows you to pass around a value type that
    /// provides read-only access to the state and the ability to dispatch actions, without exposing the full store.
    ///
    /// - Note: Use `StoreGraph` when you want to provide child components or views with access to the current state
    ///   and dispatching capabilities in a type-safe and encapsulated manner.
    ///
    /// ### Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// let graph: Store<MyState, MyAction>.GraphStore = store.graph
    /// print(graph.state) // Access the current state
    /// graph.dispatch(.increment) // Dispatch an action
    /// ```
    ///
    public typealias StoreGraph = Graph<State, Action>
    
    /// A type alias for the reducer function that handles actions and mutates the store's state.
    ///
    /// The `Reducer` defines the signature for a pure function that takes the current state (as an inout parameter)
    /// and an action, and mutates the state in response to the action. Reducers are the core mechanism for
    /// updating state in a predictable and centralized manner within the store.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - state: The current state of the store, passed as an inout parameter to allow mutation.
    ///   - action: The action to be handled, which may result in a state change.
    ///
    /// - Note: Reducers should be pure functions and must not produce side effects.
    ///         All state mutations should occur exclusively within the reducer to maintain consistency.
    ///
    /// ### Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// let reducer: Store<AppState, AppAction>.Reducer = { state, action in
    ///     switch action {
    ///     case .increment:
    ///         state.count += 1
    ///     case .decrement:
    ///         state.count -= 1
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    public typealias Reducer = (inout State, Action) -> Void
    
    /// A type alias for a state streamer that emits `GraphStore` (graph) state updates.
    ///
    /// `GraphStreamer` is a convenience alias for `StateStreamer<StoreGraph>`, allowing you to create
    /// asynchronous streams of ``StoreGraph`` values. This is typically used to drive state updates to
    /// strongly-held subscribers (drivers) within the store architecture.
    ///
    /// - Note: Use `GraphStreamer` when you want to observe or react to changes in the store's state and dispatcher
    ///   as a single, encapsulated value (`GraphStore`). The store retains strong references to installed `GraphStreamer`
    ///   instances until they are explicitly uninstalled.
    ///
    /// ### Example
    /// ```swift
    /// let driver: Store<MyState, MyAction>.GraphStreamer = .init()
    /// store.install(driver)
    /// Task {
    ///     for await graph in driver.state {
    ///         print("Received new graph state: \(graph.state)")
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    public typealias GraphStreamer = StateStreamer<StoreGraph>
    
    /// `ObjectStreamer` adopter that can receive async stream of `Graph<State, Action>`
    public typealias Streamer = ObjectStreamer<StoreGraph>
    public typealias StreamerContinuation = AsyncStream<StoreGraph>.Continuation
    
    //MARK: - Public properties
    /// The internal dispatch queue used for synchronizing state updates and store operations.
    ///
    /// All state mutations, action dispatches, and subscription management are performed synchronously on this queue
    /// to ensure thread safety. The queue's quality of service (QoS) can be configured during store initialization,
    /// allowing you to control the priority of store-related tasks.
    ///
    /// - Important: Directly submitting work to this queue from outside the store is discouraged.
    ///   Use the store's public API for all interactions to maintain thread safety and data integrity.
    ///
    /// ### Example:

    /// print(store.queue.label) // Prints the label of the store's internal queue
    /// ```
    ///
    public let queue: DispatchQueue

    ///
    /// The `reducer` is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as input,

    /// is dispatched to the store, ensuring that all state changes are predictable and centralized.
    ///
    /// - Note: The reducer should be a pure function and must not produce side effects.
